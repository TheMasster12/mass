# force-over-acceleration.js ![GA Beacon](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-43696434-2/mass/readme)

> A 3-D particle physics simulator powered by WebGL.

## About
This is a port of my [force-over-acceleration](https://github.com/mass/force-over-acceleration) project from Python to JavaScript. The intention is to create a web application that is able to run on numerous platforms.

## Motivation
I have always taken a keen interest in physics, so I have actively searched for ways to combine it with computer science. I came up with the idea for this project while pondering the [Simulated Reality Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality). I hope to advance the project to the point where highly complex visual simulations are possible.

## Future Features
- Particle interaction logic
- Approximation algorithms ([Barnes-Hut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation))
- Offload calculations to GPU
- Import simulation files
- Improved graphics and textures
- Debug data and framerate information
- Keyboard commands for controlling the simulation

## Dependencies
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [requireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs)
* [Lo-Dash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
